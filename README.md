Project: Train Scheduler

Author: Michael Benefiel

Why I created this project:

Homework for the University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp.

Feel free to use some or all of this code if you're trying to complete a similar project.

Additional Notes/Commentary:

Would like to spend more time building this out in the future.
